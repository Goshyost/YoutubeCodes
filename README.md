In this repository I will put all the codes that I use in my Youtube videos

Feel free to share or use them in your own project :D

> [!NOTE]
> There is NOT every code of my Youtube videos because I lost the original project, but I will try to remake or even update them.
> Also you may notice there are slight changes in the handler between some commands
